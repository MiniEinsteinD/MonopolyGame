UML Diagram Changes (From Milestone 1):
	- Methods added to Monopoly to make assigning values to attributes happen within the Model
	whenever a Controller is used for user input for better cohesion.
	- Methods which need to be accessed by the Controller were made public.
	- Added Getters for values that might be needed for the Views.
	- Implemented passHandler and landHandler in Tile taking inspiration from Observer Pattern
	so that new Tiles like the Go Tile could be added more easily, and for better cohesion.
	- Added toString implementation to Tile so that any child class could be easily represented
	as a string by calling the toString of their parent class.
	- buy and move now pass a StringBuilder as arguments to methods they call to store info to be
	printed.
	- Added isBankrupt function to Player so that the user would not have to manually compute if
	wallet < 0 every time they need to know if a Player is bankrupt.


Data Structure Changes (From Milestone 1):
	- Changing the print statments to a StringBuilder data type in order to use it as text for the GUI version.
