Player
------
    - 


RailroadTile
--------------
    - Although the RailroadTile utilizes many of the same methods and attributes of the property tile it was deemed
    that using a separate class rather than practicing inheritance from the Property class would be the best direction


UtilityTile
------------
    - Although the UtilityTile utilizes many of the same methods and attributes of the property tile it was deemed
    that using a separate class rather than practicing inheritance from the Property class would be the best direction


Buyable interface
------------------------
    - A buyable interface allows for polymorphism within the Tile class which was necessary as more than one
    implementation of the Tile class was purchasable by the player and multiple others cannot be purchased by the
    player.
