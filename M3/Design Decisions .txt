Project
--------
    - Decided to allow only active player to purches houses/hotels to make the process simpler. 

Monopoly
---------
    - Changing generateRoll method from private to public for testing purposes. 

PlayerBot
----------
    - Player AI implemented in its own class because it has the behaviour of a controller (with the key difference
    that Monopoly is calling its methods and they are not a response to user input).
    - Methods and attributes are static because its behaviour does not depend on information specific to a particular
    Player (that can't be accessed from the Player with getters and setters).

RailroadTile
--------------
    - Although the RailroadTile utilizes many of the same methods and attributes of the property tile it was deemed
    that using a separate class rather than practicing inheritance from the Property class would be the best direction


UtilityTile
------------
    - Although the UtilityTile utilizes many of the same methods and attributes of the property tile it was deemed
    that using a separate class rather than practicing inheritance from the Property class would be the best direction


Buyable interface
------------------------
    - A buyable interface allows for polymorphism within the Tile class which was necessary as more than one
    implementation of the Tile class was purchasable by the player and multiple others cannot be purchased by the
    player.
