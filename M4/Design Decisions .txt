Monopoly
---------
    -  We decided to create a new class called Version Format to handle the implementation of the international versions feature.
	The reason for creating this new class is to reduce coupling within the Monopoly class. 

    -Added clear views method to facilitate loading serialized monopoly objects without creating two views (E.H. 101145675)

XML (U.M. 101158792)
--------------------
    - XML files were added in this milestone; it uses human, not computer, language, and it is readable and understandable. Also, XML is 
	completely compatible with Java and 100% portable.
    - Two XML files were added to store international Monopoly boards. The first one is the English version of the board and the second
	one is the Arabic version of the board; both have different currencies (US dollar and Iraqi Dinar respectively).
