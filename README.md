SYSC 3110 Project - Monopoly

Project Description
This project is a design and implementation of a simplified version of the classic boardgame Monopoly. The game is simplified by eliminating the Chance/Community chest cards and by not allowing mortgages nor sales and trades between players. The cost of rent, houses and hotels will be simplified to represent fixed percentages of the initial cost of the property.
